Building the best restaurant website doesn’t have to be a time-consuming or difficult task. In many cases, there are simple things you can build into your website to share the most important information with your frequent and potential guests, especially as a way to direct customer traffic to online ordering. 

A great restaurant website supports all of your restaurant marketing activities: it can attract new customers, maintain loyal ones, and raise the overall profile of the establishment outside of the physical location. It's a crucial aspect of running a successful business. 

As you work to create a restaurant website, keep customer data in mind. Gathering, and using, customer data in the right way can maximize your ability to attract, retain, and deepen the connection with your guests. 

For example, with an easy online ordering system featured prominently on your site, a guest decides to order right from you, instead of using a third party site. During this process, they sign up for your newsletter, and create an account to become a part of your loyalty program. Now you can use that email data to re-target that guest with an email marketing campaign encouraging them to purchase a gift card, or a small welcome gift with your loyalty program. The guest can then use that gift card or coupon code to come back and order delivery for date night at home, being rewarded as a regular by accruing loyalty points. Then, they’ll tell their friends, or bring them along to the restaurant, and the guest experience flow begins again.

An important piece of creating this guest experience flywheel is website optimization, and having the options and capabilities available and prominent on your website to build a strong guest relationship.

The best restaurant websites include:
The basics: contact info, hours, location

An up to date menu

Online ordering

A way to make reservations

The restaurant’s social media accounts

Gift card purchasing

An email collection form
